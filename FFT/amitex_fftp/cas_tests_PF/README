IMPLEMENTATIONS OF VARIOUS PHASE FILEDS IN THE AMITEX_FFTP "NON-LOCAL" FRAMEWORK (number "3" at the end of filenames)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING : 
The following phase-field model implementations are first examples, they are probably not optimized 


Cahn-Hilliard : Cahn-Hilliard model, one field, with mechanical coupling (used in the 'elast' case)

Grain-Growth  : Gindzburg-Laundau model, 10 fields (one per grain), no mechanical coupling

Kochman       : Gindzburg-Laundau model, one field, with mechanical coupling
