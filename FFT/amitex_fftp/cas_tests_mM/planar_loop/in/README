This is the directory where all the input files of the simulation mM are located!

To run a standard DD simulation, one need to define  three input files identified thanks to "input.dd"
--> the material variables file                   (e.g. Cu)
--> the control parameters file                   (e.g. ContCu)
--> the intial dislocation configuration file     (e.g. SegCu)

Few exemples of such files, corresponding to different types of materials or simulation experiments, are provided
in the directories :

mM_Materials_files  -> exemples of materials files
mM_Control_files    -> exemples of control files
mM_Segments_files   -> exemples of segments files

--------

Additional exemples of input files are given in

mM_Data_Files:
- eulerangle_dat    -> the file with data used to impose lattice rotation in aggregate simulations
- f2p_dat           -> the file with data used to convert the mM film output in paraview data files
- linetension_dat   -> the file with data used to run simulations with anisotropic line tension calculation
...


mM_Def_files:
- b_domains_def     -> the file with data used to run simulated volumes with free or non penetrable boundaries
- confinit_def      -> the file with data used to generate initial configuration
                        initial configurations are made with the option "./mm --initconf"
                        this option generate an input segment file   mM/in/New_conf
- crack_def         -> the file with data used to run the simulation with a crack field load
- FE_Sig_def        -> the file with data used to run the simulation with an heterogeneous stress field taken
                        for instance from an FEM calculation
- matrotation_def   -> the file with data used to rotate the simulation lattice with a given rotation matrix
- nucl_def          -> the file with data used to run simulation with the nucleation local rule
- particules_def    -> the file with data used to defined a distribution of particles in the simulated volume
- tensapp_def       -> the file with the definition of a complex applied stress tensor
